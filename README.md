The challenge for this assignment was to review and make optimmizational changes to the HTML and CSS. Noting strucural semantics changes, there was a great deal of consolidating some of the class and element selctors that were similar. In doing so, the CSS was reduced in size without affecting the form and functionality of the website. Comments are also added to the changes that were made throughout CSS. 

From an HTML perspective, minor changes included adding headers, alt attributes to the images, adding a footer and repairing the linking of a callout int the navbar.

**Installation**

Once the changes to the HTML and CSS have been made, the files have been pulled into the current repository and subsequent URL page has been created.

The image below shows exmaples within the CSS where consolidation efforts were performed when certain selectors were found to be similar and combined for efficiency of the CSS without degradation to the HTML.
